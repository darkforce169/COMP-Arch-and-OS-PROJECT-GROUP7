REST API by group 7

 Instructions to run the rest api and start the server are in the video.
 
 JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR
 Run the server in your project directory. For example, in the video the project directory is RESTAPI2. So to run the server, cd to project directory in cmd-> type "node script.js". Listening on port should mean that server is running.
